          Hey there, I'm Casper
        </h1>
        <p>
          I am currently studying to become a University Engineer in Computer Science at the Royal Institute of Technology in
          Stockholm, Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>
          My great interest in computer technology has already been rewarded through a large number of computer science
          projects, which you can read all about here on my portfolio homepage. I have recently started two companies: one in
          the USA for traffic analytics together with my sister and her professor and one company in Sweden for my consulting
          services.

        <p>Casper Kristiansson developed a mass image editing program for the Personnel Foundation of the Swedish postal

          such as changing the width and height, brightness, sharpness, vignette, vibrance and much more. The program applies
          all changes to the selected images. The program also included a version where the user is able to go through an
          image at a time a changing the image properties. The program enables the PostNordPlus to save large amount of time
          specifically for images that will be uploaded to a website.</p>
        <p>Casper Kristiansson was responsible to develop both the frontend and backend of the program which includes a

          On the website twitch a user is able to “clip” a part of a livestream and upload it to the platform. These clips often
          get a lot of attention and often attracts millions of views. With this solution using twitch API and YouTube dl makes
          it possible to download popular clips from the platform and uploading the clips to YouTube using their data v3 API.

        <p>This program is a simplified version of the image editor where it is possible to automatically run for ever where it
          downloads images from images from unsplash.com, edits them to a specific width and height and an overlay. It than adds
          a quote and a logo to the image. The image is than uploaded to Instagram. The project objective is to automate an
          Instagram account which would be able to run indefinitely and keep upload content which its followers could enjoy.
